				Before transitioning into web development, I spent nearly a decade in customer service, fraud investigation, and onboarding coordinationâ€”
				roles that demanded empathy, precision, and systems thinking.

				These experiences shaped how I approach software today: with a deep respect for user needs, clear communication, and scalable problem-solving.
				My technical skills are still growing, but my foundation in collaboration, compliance, and client care is rock solid.
