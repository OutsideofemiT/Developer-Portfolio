# 💻 Developer Portfolio – Carmen Wheeler

Welcome to my portfolio! I’m a **MERN stack developer** with a passion for building full-stack applications that are both functional and user-focused. My journey has taken me from bootcamp projects to collaborative cohort work, and now into freelance client development.  

Currently pursuing:
- 📜 **SEO & Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Certification**
- 📜 **AI for Engineers Certification (DataCamp)**

This portfolio highlights 4 key projects from different stages of my developer journey:
